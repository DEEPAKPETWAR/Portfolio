      Hi, I'm Deepak, a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for building scalable, dynamic, and user-friendly web applications. My journey into web development began Kodu, and ever since, I've been eager to create solutions that not only work well but also provide a great experience for the user.

I specialize in using technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create both the front-end and back-end of web applications. Whether it's building a smooth, responsive UI or developing an efficient, secure API, I love to craft solutions that users enjoy and developers appreciate.

Throughout my career, I've worked on various projects, where I had the chance to tackle complex problems and develop clean, maintainable code.
